# Abstract

# The Problem - Govt Grant Disbursal System

**Governments face immense challenges in responding to emergencies**
-The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected employment and living standards. The World Bank’s rapid phone surveys show that, on average, 20%6 of households report receiving assistance, but the rate of assistance widely varies across countries. For example, 70% of Indonesians surveyed report receiving assistance, while fewer than 10% of individuals in sub- Saharan Africa report receiving assistance.

-Emergencies have long-term consequences for the macro-economy
The COVID-19 pandemic’s macro-economic consequences may significantly affect investment, human capital, and global trade. The pandemic will downgrade economic growth in every region, and a global recession could have long-term impacts on economic and labor productivity. These impacts are likely to disproportionately affect emerging economies.

-The economic fallout from emergencies pushes households into poverty, and low- and middle-income countries are disproportionately affected
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected employment and living standards. The World Bank estimates that over 150 million people1 from low- and middle-income countries will be forced into extreme poverty due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Globally, due to the pandemic, income has decreased and food prices have increased by 14%,2 resulting in many households being unable to meet their nutritional needs.

>A survey of 40 countries shows that 36%3 of individuals working before the pandemic ceased working, and 62%4 of households lost income during the pandemic.
Child poverty and hunger have also increased during the pandemic. In sub-Saharan Africa, poverty rates increased by 10%5 and are expected to increase by 20% by the end of the pandemic, and the number of children experiencing food insecurity increased by 14%.

**The Solution **

-Building a centralized platform as a one stop solution 
-The citizen could apply to the government schemes, policies and grants via this platform.
-The citizen may not need to go in person to many government offices to collect the document for applying.
-The citizen could make a request for the required document via this platform to the respective stakeholders.
-The progress of the application is informed to the citizen in real time 
-The officer can do the required verification on the platform itself and let the citizen know what is missing in the application
-As we advance we could use AI for verification purposes
-The government could update citizen about the new schemes and policies through this platform 
-The citizen would not miss any chance for applying and they would be promptly updated 


**The Benefits **
**Benefits to Government**
-Improve targeting and reach
-Using digital verification and enrollment can improve targeting to ensure benefits reach the groups with the greatest need. 
-Digital payments can more efficiently reach individuals outside the formal economy, individuals living in rural areas, and other hard-to-reach or vulnerable groups including women.
-Disburse benefits quickly 
-Digital payments can reduce administrative transaction costs for governments, enabling governments to issue payments quickly. 
-Improve efficiency
-Digital payments can improve efficiency by reducing costs to both government and beneficiaries.
-Distributing benefits electronically can stem fraud, especially in the form of bribes extracted at service points.
-This system also has the potential to reduce the administrative costs to governments associated with distributing benefits and to reduce travel costs and lost wages associated with commuting to access benefits.
-Stabilize macro economy
-Quick, efficient, and targeted government payments can infuse the economy with cash and protect businesses.
-Benefits to Individuals
-Receive Emergency Benefits in a Timely Manner
-Digitization allows payments to reach beneficiaries immediately. 
-Digital enrollment and distribution channels reduce the amount of time it takes to process beneficiary applications and transfer payments to beneficiaries. 
-Governments’ rapid emergency response is also aided by digitization of payments to government workers, especially healthcare workers, and digitization of applications for emergency assistance.
-Improve Efficiency and Security of Benefits
-Digital payments reduce transaction costs and improve the security of delivery. 
-For the government, digitization of payments is administratively cheaper and allows for more efficient onboarding of beneficiaries and delivery of benefits. 
**For individuals**, digitization reduces the costs and insecurity associated with travel to receive benefits. 
-Contactless payments can also reduce exposure to disease, allow citizens and residents to comply with curfews and shutdowns, and reach individuals who have been dislodged from their homes due to an emergency.
-Smooth Consumption and Resilience to Shocks
-Digital payments can help beneficiaries meet their immediate needs when their income and financial security are disrupted by emergencies.			


**Risks**
**Exclusion Errors**
-Digital targeting and distribution may miss certain intended beneficiaries. Targeting may be imperfect if the benefit relies on identification or other credentials that certain groups are unable to attain. 
-Additionally, certain beneficiaries may be enrolled in the digital program but may be unable to access the benefit due to failures in activating digital accounts.
**Insufficient Infrastructure**
-A developed digital infrastructure increases the benefits of digitizing emergency response. Without the ability to either easily cash out their benefits or use their benefits to pay for services digitally, beneficiaries’ ability to actually use their benefits are limited. 
-Lack of connectivity may also limit beneficiaries’ ability to access their benefits. This issue may be especially salient for those living in rural areas
**Misconduct among Providers**
-Digitizing emergency response opens beneficiaries to misconduct by providers such as agents overcharging beneficiaries to cash out their benefit payments. Emergency response should be accompanied by robust consumer protection regulations and practices that address the misconduct unique to digital financial services
**Lack of Digital Literacy**
-Access to emergency support may be limited due to beneficiaries’ lack of familiarity with digital systems. Beneficiaries with low levels of digital literacy may have particular issues with both accessing and using emergency benefits delivered digitally.
**Increased Complexity**
-Digitizing emergency response relies on several different systems, including digital identification, mobile penetration, and cash-in/cash-out (CICO) agent networks. If these interconnected systems are not well functioning, it may be difficult to implement a digital emergency support. Thus, the government needs to establish these systems and necessary infrastructure prior to an emergency.
**Gender Gaps**
-Digitizing emergency response could exacerbate gender gaps or leave out women. Women are less likely to have access to identification, have lower levels of mobile phone ownership, and have lower levels of financial literacy. Thus, emergency response that ignores these gaps could inadvertently disadvantage women.

>Governments around the world are leveraging the spread of digital technologies to improve their capacity to serve their citizens and residents.
Social grants are being directly transferred to bank or mobile money accounts, and other public services also now utilize digital identification and digital financial channels. 		

-Evidence suggests that digitization of government services can benefit governments, citizens and residents, and the private sector 
if digitization makes services more convenient and easy to control. 						
>The road to digitization is not without challenges, 
including the issue of building on legacy systems, outmoded financial regulation, the need to protect the personal information of individuals, and potential for digitization to lead to exclusion errors and widening of the digital divide. There is also risk that governments can misuse the technology to yield excessive control over their citizens and residents.
